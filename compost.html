            <h2>What is Composting?</h2>
            <p>Composting is nature's way of recycling organic materials into rich soil that can be used to grow healthy plants.
                Composting is an eco-friendly process of recycling organic waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer for plants and soil. It involves the natural decomposition of materials like food scraps, garden clippings, leaves, and biodegradable items under controlled conditions. By combining green waste (rich in nitrogen) with brown waste (rich in carbon) and maintaining adequate moisture and aeration, microorganisms break down the materials into humus, a dark, crumbly, and earthy-smelling product. Composting reduces the amount of organic waste sent to landfills, cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions while improving soil health and fertility. It is a sustainable practice that supports waste management and promotes circular use of resources, making it an essential component of environmental conservation efforts.
